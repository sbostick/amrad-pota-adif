Question
--------

Can I record and submit QSO records that would not qualify for points based on
my operating class by marking the records as "X-QSO" instead of "QSO"?

I made one contact from a secondary mobile location and I want him to get
credit for the contact but I excluded it because it doesn't qualify for my
"single-operator, fm-only, fixed-location, low-power" classification.
